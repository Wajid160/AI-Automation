# AI Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my **AI & Agentic AI Automation** project repository. This collection showcases production-ready automation solutions built using cutting-edge AI technologies, agentic workflows, and intelligent systems.

## 🎯 Mission

To develop practical, scalable AI automation solutions across various business domains, with a focus on **agentic AI principles** that combine reasoning, tool usage, and autonomous decision-making.

## 🚀 Current Focus: Customer Support Automation

I'm currently building comprehensive AI-powered customer support solutions that reduce operational costs, improve response times, and enhance customer experience.

### Featured Project: Shopify WISMO Agent

📦 **[WISMO (Where Is My Order) AI Agent](Customer-Support/Shopify-Customer-Support/WISMO-Agent/)**

An autonomous AI agent that handles order status inquiries for Shopify stores by:
- Reading incoming customer emails automatically
- Extracting Order IDs or customer emails
- Retrieving real-time order data from Shopify
- Generating accurate, policy-compliant responses
- Never hallucinating order details

**Tech Stack:** n8n, Shopify API, Gmail API, Google Gemini, LangChain Agent
